## Code breakdown  

> Disclaimer: code written in c++  

1. Replacing main function:  
replace `ulong main(void)` --> `int main(void)`  
2. Understanding the code:  

`basic_string<> local_68 [32]`  
> array of 32 `std: :basic_string<>` objects.  
Likely a placeholder from decompilation, possibly representing a single string.  

`basic_string local_48 [40]`
> array of 40 `std::basic_string<>` objects.  
Likely a single string.
